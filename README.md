# AIFROMSCRATCH 

## Objective 

There are two reasons why I started this project:

1. I’ve been feeling quite frustrated with the ML/AI courses I’ve taken. It’s not that they lack substance, but they just don’t meet my expectations. So, I’ve decided to chart my own journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence. This might not be the most organized or well-documented path for everyone, but it’s how I believe the field should be taught. If you find this interesting, please feel free to correct me if I’m wrong about anything—I’m no expert, just someone who’s still learning.
> I genuinely believe that the main issue with education is that we all process information differently.

2. Secondly, working on this project helps me hone and sharpen my AI skills.
